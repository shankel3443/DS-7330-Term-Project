405,friendly,"As english visitors, the staff were very polite and courteous which was probably the only people during our stay whom we found to be courteous,  so thank you IHG."
406,loud,Throughout my stay there were two people hotel staff (a man and woman) numerously knocking on our door and when answered they will say 'wrong door sorry'  or ' does your room need cleaning' to which we will respond 'no' to.
407,loud,We could clearly hear voices from adjacent rooms until late in the night.
408,loud,"Only downsides were the rooms were not sound proofed very well, 2 nights we were kept awake by our noisy neighbours, the breakfast could be better with more frequent replenishments and finally if you are claustrophobic please note you will not be able to use the tiny lift!"
409,loud,Rooms are relatively small but didn't feel cramped - I guess the only downside is the walls are quite thin so you can hear other people chatting in adjacent rooms/hallways.
410,loud,Do not recommend the garden rooms as it can get very loud on the bottom floor and unpleasant noises coming from above.
411,loud,"Although, the outside noise level while trying to sleep was disturbing at times."
412,loud,I was placed on a top bunk which was right next to the A/C unit which made weird noises on and off the whole night long.
413,loud,Rooms do have city noise which is to be expected.
414,loud,Not a fan of the shower arrangement and noise from adjacent rooms wear a source of irritation a couple times.
415,loud,"Also, doors on the whole floor were so massive and loud that walls of the room literally shook with every closing/opening which made it very hard to fall asleep at night."
416,neutral,"By accident the cleaning threw away the boxes from our shopping at for some designer shoes, where the original recipts where in the boxes."
417,neutral,"As I found out, the hotel is working with an external company which cleans the rooms."
418,neutral,"The room was quite small, though not uncomfortable, but this was not an issue as we really only needed a place to come back to at night."
419,neutral,"If you are traveling with family, please chose this hotel and you will be glad that you did ."
420,neutral,The hotel itself was fairly basic but perfectly good for our needs as a family of 4 - 2 adults and 16 and 12 yr old kids.
421,neutral,Taxi is expensive affair and taxi drivers will take you through various routes and try and empty your pockets.
422,neutral,"We’ve stayed a dozens of hostels, a fair few St Christophers also."
423,neutral,"It’s a fairly standard hostel, multiple bunks in my room (4)."
424,neutral,I hope I can make it back in the fall to enjoy my status one more time??
425,neutral,Lots of mirrors which is where some hotels often fall short.
426,neutral,"Coming from the US or other smaller town the room for two might feel small, but is much spacious with respect to standard Paris double rooms."
427,neutral,"The decor was fun and fresh, and while it could feel a bit small in the elevator and halls, I felt that added to this boutique hotel's charm and I felt the"
428,neutral,Full of nice restaurants and you get an immersive feeling given all the locals drinking and eating outside.
429,neutral,The location of the hotel was ideal for us to feel centralized to the main tourist attractions and metro.
430,neutral,I can't really fault Hotel Darcet which is why I feel I want to write this review.
431,neutral,The way it’s designed and decorated feels new and fresh.
432,neutral,"Hotel de Neuville, 17e Paris While this hotel has a homely feeling it is a deception in several ways."
433,neutral,"Customer service, I think you only get a feel of how how good customer service is if there’s a problem, and we had a problem with our booking."
434,neutral,The choice was good and the fresh bread (especially the one with crunchy crust and raisins) was amazing!!!
435,neutral,"Breakfast buffet was always great, fresh coffee, scrambled eggs and the best of all, my boyfriend got a chance to taste gluten-free stuff."
436,neutral,The breakfast is simple but everything is fresh and tasty.
437,neutral,The breakfast was terrific - a huge selection of fresh food and drink choices.
438,neutral,"It was refreshing to watch, especially since everything we had heard about Paris before arriving was warning you would have trouble communicating."
439,neutral,The way it’s designed and decorated feels new and fresh.
440,neutral,"Returned to this property during a short visit to Paris based on previous experience and knowledge of the area and what to expect; however, it seems since the last visit (several years prior) there's been no improvements and the property is desperately in need of a refresh to the rooms."
441,neutral,The breakfast selection was great and the food tasted very fresh every morning.
442,neutral,We stayed at this lovely little hotel for three delightful nights!
443,neutral,"An art deco theme, the lighting showcases men's top hats, beautiful and thoughtful touches throughout the rooms and hotel."
444,neutral,The final delight factor was that it was within walking distance of the Gare du Nord
445,neutral,"It is slightly worn, casual, cheerful and youth-oriented; it is not a fancy or luxury property."
446,neutral,We stayed here last minute after flight was cancelled.
447,neutral,Upon our request our room was changed to Room 2 (next room) which was only (very slightly) bigger than Room 1 but had a limitation of broken window which could not
448,neutral,Got some great photos and got to watch the lights sparkle during the evening hours while even laying in bed.
449,neutral,We arrived about 2 pm after a long trip via Heathrow with poor service on the Virgin Atlantic due to staff shortages and then a 90 minute delayed Air France flight to CDG.
450,neutral,I liked card only access to elevators and how hallway lights turned up when you exited room or elevator.
451,neutral,Imagine receiving that email one week from when your flight arrives!
452,neutral,"A slight downside along with a lack of drawer space, but for the short time we stayed we coped and the walking did mean my wife soon forgot about having a firm pillow."
453,neutral,"An art deco theme, the lighting showcases men's top hats, beautiful and thoughtful touches throughout the rooms and hotel."
454,neutral,We are looking forward to returning and have already booked another stay.
455,neutral,We had a room with a little balkony overlooking the rue.
456,neutral,That also looked a
457,neutral,I don't care about Opera views as I don't look out the window too often.
458,neutral,"Just returned from a 4 night stay at the Lorette and we had an amazing stay from start to finish.Having looked around at hundreds of hotels in Paris, we decided on the Lorette and we were certainly not disappointed."

461,neutral,We were really looking forward to our stay and the hotel delivered!
462,neutral,I look forward to staying again!
463,neutral,Our room was beautiful and overlooked the Comic Opéra.
464,neutral,"If your looking for a cute hotel close by the Effel tower, go to La Comtesse!"
465,neutral,I looked for something similarly priced.
466,neutral,"I booked a standard room, which was a bit smaller than it looks in the pictures, so I would highly advise booking one of the larger rooms as this one didn’t have much space for bags or to get ready with two people."
467,neutral,"Our room, #204 over looking the inner yard, was big by all parisian standard, approx 20 sqm, doted with a very large closet (well enought for 3 people), where we could find a nespresso machine."
468,neutral,They had a very sad and small looking club lounge which I would not pay extra to access.
469,neutral,I think all the rooms look out either on the internal courtyard or the square.
470,neutral,We did not try the breakfast but it looked great.
471,neutral,We did have a look at the Italian restaurant within the hotel but it’s not really suitable for children.
472,neutral,"Being 40, I felt really old going to a hostel but the double I got on the 6th floor was great, with a fabulous balcony overlooking a kids playground and the canal close by."
473,neutral,The place is near a metro station and in a very good place to leave😊😊definitely looking forward to next time!
474,neutral,"Stayed for 4 nights, room overlooking canal towards city center."
475,neutral,"On the first floor is a deck area sometimes used by people using the meeting rooms, it was great to sit looking over the canal with a drink and a snack."
476,neutral,"Our room was overlooking the canal, we took walks along the canal bank in the evenings and morning."
477,neutral,"Our third stay here, whenever we cross (beneath) the Channel from the UK."
478,neutral,"There isn't a traditional lobby; but, there is a large room with tables where you can enjoy a meal you've picked up."
479,neutral,Location is near to metro station but far away for main attractions / sightseeing pickup points.
480,neutral,I stayed in Hotel Bradford Elysees for 8 nights and I can safely say that this is one of the best hotels ever!!
481,neutral,"The bathroom was very large for a hotel room, and there was a large closet, a mini fridge, and a safe."
482,neutral,"They were also gracious to change our room when we requested a change due to the size of the room Good facilities - All rooms have a safety locker / hot water kettle  (not common in Paris), spacious elevators (helpful to carry luggage upstairs)  Negatives:  The room allotted to us (Room 1 on first floor) was very small."
483,neutral,"You did leave your key with reception when you left the hotel, there was also the option to request a safe key which we did."
484,neutral,The only quibble:  Lack of a safe in the room.
485,neutral,"It is located within walking distance of several metro lines but before you decide to ride those, do your research into keeping yourself safe!"
486,neutral,Thanks to Nirosha dining staff who made my bday cake.
487,neutral,I witnessed the staff speaking to guests in several different languages.
488,neutral,"Confronted with the situation, the otherwise polite hotel staff got very quiet."

490,neutral,"The staff generally did not wear masks,  but I guess they are vaccinated."
491,neutral,I had to go and ask staff for some spare towels to mop up the water.
492,neutral,I let the staff know but not sure if anything was done.
493,neutral,Umami restaurant staff were new and weren’t as trained as one would expect at this class of hotel.
494,neutral,This probably accounts for why it always appears to be understaffed or staffed with untrained employees.
495,neutral,"Very close to several metro stations to take you all over Paris and a short walk from several cafes, restaurants, boulangeries and even a pharmacy just a stones throw away."
496,quiet,"I did appreciate the soundproofing of the room, which was not silent but fairly quiet."
497,quiet,The hotel is fairly new and very quiet.
498,quiet,We experienced a quite and fresh stay.
499,quiet,"Had a corner room on the third floor that overlooked the courtyard, which made it very quite, could sleep with window open, but air con very good if needed."

506,safe,"Warm, safe, welcoming, and lovely garden to relax and have a espresso in after a long flight to beat the jet lag!"
507,safe,"I found the area around the hotel to be quite safe, with various food options nearby, and in particular a pharmacy and mini-supermarket down the steet."
508,safe,"The location of this hotel is also exceptional, as it's on a safe and quiet street with plenty of dining options nearby."
509,safe,"Warm, safe, welcoming, and lovely garden to relax and have a espresso in after a long flight to beat the jet lag!"
510,safe,Very glad we found this one as it’s in a nice safe neighbourhood with plenty of bars and restaurants nearby.
511,safe,There is no hotel that was cleaner and safer than Hotel Darcet.
512,safe,The place is close to bars and restaurants and it is located in an area that is safe to go for walks even late in the night.
513,safe,it was so quiet and felt really safe.
514,safe,The hotel felt safe and I felt that I could trust the hotel staff.
515,safe,"The streets nearby have numerous small restaurants, bakeries, bars, and fruit and vegetable shops, and seemed very safe for an evening stroll."
516,safe,"Great welcome, safe and comfortable."
517,smell,The hotel was spotless and their attention to detail is just unreal... the decor and smell of the hotel is to die for and my favourite thing were the beds!!!
518,smelly,"There is a bar underneath the rooms which is nice but the rooms were dirty, smelly, the windows were locked shut, and filled with high schoolers who were obviously just looking for a place to hookup."
519,smelly,"We checked in at the Executive Lounge and Gilles gave us a great room on a high floor, but it smelled of mold and mildew so we returned to the lounge and got a room that we could breath in."
520,smelly,The only negative from our stay was the shower… it was so tiny and had a curtain all the way around that smelled and didn’t prevent water from leaking out all over the floor.
521,smelly,Rooms that smell like toe jam!
522,smelly,"There is a kitchen available (had an odd smell--could have been great stinky cheese, who knows...)."
523,smelly,I did not like the smell in the bathroom.
524,uncomfortable,Mattress not very comfortable.
525,uncomfortable,The bed was so uncomfortable that I woke up each morning with a back pain.
526,uncomfortable,The bathroom could use some improvements - my cosmetics kept falling off the shelf in the shower and the mirrors above the sinks are hung at wrong height (made it hard to access the sink while washing my face etc.).
527,uncomfortable,"The unseasonably hot September weather meant the aircon was struggling to keep us cool, and the windows don't open wide (for safety) so not as comfy as usual."
528,unfriendly,"The manager at the reception: We are cleaning it, you have to wait and we can’t estimate when you’ll get your room."
529,unfriendly,The cleaning ladies entered the room while the people were sleeping to arrange it before the check out time.
530,unfriendly,"We stayed for 5 nights , i would say please don't expect to have average room size , only 2 medium size bag and 2 backpacks can fit in if you want to move around room barely  They don't have enough staff anytime of the day."
531,unfriendly,"Everyone else pretty much really dropped the ball when it came to being of any help, especially the skater boy looking kid (you’ll"
532,unfriendly,The staff is extremely rude and super unhelpful.
533,unfriendly,"We stayed for 5 nights , i would say please don't expect to have average room size , only 2 medium size bag and 2 backpacks can fit in if you want to move around room barely  They don't have enough staff anytime of the day."
534,unsafe,"I would have felt safer with masks required, and no vaccine requirement, since I do not feel safer with vaccines."
